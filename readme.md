# Golang Production Ready Bootstrap Web Server.

This is a startup template for Golang.

## Stracture

## As a fist think
-- Make sure you don't have anything runs on port 80

Can be APACHE running on the background.

### Docker Containers
nginx , mysql and api(Golang).

### Nginx
- https2 configuration
- automate script for /etc/hosts ( so you can use https://www.yourdomain.com for your local development)

### Mysql
Can be swap with any db container but I like to use mysql.

### Golang Rest Api.
- [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) for hot reload (This will detect changes and rebuild the app on file change)
- folder struct
- DB integration
- example route , controller , 
- middlewares (rest logger , session , cors)
- Auth with JWT


## Installation
### Requirements.
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
